### Introduction
Hi all! I'm Penny. This project is built for legacy iOS devices (<A7) . As is known to all, it's getting harder for jailbreakers to get tweaks. So I set up this repo to solve this problem. If you met any problem, you can create an issue directly or email [^me]

### Copyright
If you're the developer, and you found your tweaks published on my repo without getting any request before, please let me know. I'll remove them as quickly as possible.
